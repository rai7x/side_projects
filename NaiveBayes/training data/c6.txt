Lentil Soup (seriously amazing!)


























All it takes is a hint of spice flavourings, bay leaves and finishing it off with a touch of lemon to elevate this soup. It’s an easy recipe that delivers terrific results, a 5 star reader favourite with hundreds of feedback from readers!
Lentil soup is quite possibly the least sexy sounding soup on the planet.
At least, in my world. Regular readers know that I’m all about big flavours. Spicy, herby, 
 – kapow, kapow, kapow!
But you know what? A well made Lentil Soup recipe is can’t-stop-eating-it good. You’ll go back for seconds and thirds, then you’ll be taking big tubs of it to work for lunch and happily have it for dinner again.
And – I’m going to say it (*head swell*) – plenty of readers have said this is the 
they’ve ever had!
A well made Lentil Soup recipe is can’t-stop-eating-it good.
If you’re wondering if lentil soup is good for you, the answer is 
 
, rich in minerals, protein, low in fat, high in fibre (digestive health). They are a terrific vegetarian 
 with 25% of the calories in lentils attributable to protein.
Lentils are a carbohydrate, but it’s slow burning which means it keeps you fuller for longer. Studies also suggest that lentils are good for heart health.
The added benefit is that they are low in calories with 116 calories in 1 cup of cooked lentils (which is roughly the amount per serving of this lentil soup).
It tastes savoury and has a flavour boost from a hint of spices. There’s an undertone of natural sweetness from the 
 flavour base of onion, carrot and celery. My favourite part is the texture! It’s thick and comforting, and just made for dunking in hot crusty bread!
Here’s what goes in my lentil soup. Nothing fancy, just everyday ingredients.




A touch of spices.






Cooking the onion, carrot and celery slowly so they sweeten and make a beautiful flavour base.






The “secret” ingredient.
Yes really. Little tip I picked up from Ina Garten. Just a bit of zest and squeeze of fresh lemon 
 which takes it from really good to 




Nope! Dried lentils cook in 35 minutes 
 the soup, and there’s no need to soak them either!
Dried lentils are best for lentil soup. You can use most types of lentils for this recipe – brown, green, red or yellow, though it will affect the colour of the soup. I’ve used green lentils, pictured below.
The only type of lentil I 
 (little black French lentils) because they hold their shape and don’t soften like other lentils.
Can you used canned cooked lentils?
Yes you sure can, and directions are provided in the recipe notes. But it’s better made with dried lentils because of the texture in the soup, there’s only 10 minutes difference in cook time and it’s more economical!




Sauté your onion, garlic, carrots and celery over over low heat for almost 10 minutes. 
 – the lower the heat, the longer you take, the more these will transform to create an incredible flavour base for the soup!






Add everything else other than the lemon;






Simmer 35 minutes until lentils are soft; and






Finish with a dusting of zest and spritz of lemon.




A hint of lemon earthiness from the zest and 
 from the juice just jazzes up the soup and takes it to that next level!
You’ll find that the lentils mostly breakdown and naturally thicken the soup. But what I like to do to get a really luscious creamy texture is to give the soup a 
 with a blender stick (or transfer a couple of cups to the blender) to puree SOME but not all the lentils.
That way you get the benefit of both worlds – creamy soup with soft bits of lentils. YES!
Lentil Soup will easily keep for 5 days in the fridge, making it ideal for cooking on the weekend and serving throughout the week. And it also freezes 100% perfectly for 3 months – even longer!
Every time I make this, I always wonder why I don’t make it more often. It’s healthy, filling, super economical, freezes perfectly, versatile and it’s 
Serving this with some sort of warm crusty bread for dunking is not optional. It’s an essential part of the Lentil Soup experience.
But it 
 optional whether you slather said bread with butter, or grill it with cheese!  Here are a few options – including making your own ultra easy

He contributes less than nothing to this household, he actually contributes 
Dropping fur everywhere, shaking vigorously so it flies everywhere along with an inordinate amount of sand, constantly sprawling out in my path so I’m forced to step over him (remember, I’m vertically challenged = giant steps).
Giant 💩 all over the backyard. Barks furiously at tree branches swaying in the breeze but I swear, he would happily show a robber where my jewellery box is in exchange for a pat.
Useless!!! (And yet we love them so much, don’t we? 🙂)
PS Another example of his uselessness – he spends 22 hours a day doing this. The other 2 hours are spent a) eating b) hoping to eat c) playing.

I believe you can make great food with everyday ingredients even if you’re short on time and cost conscious. You just need to cook clever and get creative!

This is a dish that pleases both the vegetarian and carnivores I cook for!

(I just add bacon at the end as a garnish – bacon makes everything better).

Only sad thing is, it never lasts 5 days – it’s devoured well before then








 
 
YES! Love this Kelly!! N x

Thanks for the recipe






 
 

I made this as a quick lunch on a rainy winter’s day and it was perfect. Made it in my Instant Pot: sautéed the veggies and cooked everything on high pressure for 10 minutes with natural release for 10 minutes. It truly is the yummiest lentil soup I’ve had. Thank you for consistently great recipes!






 
 
Hi. I love all your recipes and am looking forward to making this one. Can I use fresh bay leaves instead of dried as I have a tree in my garden?

Thanks








 
 
Yes 100% Maria!! N x

Reading about Dozer , Nancy Mitford wrote in ” The pursuit of love ” ““Even if I take him out for three hours every day, and go and chat to him for another hour, that leaves twenty hours for him all alone with nothing to do. Oh, why can’t dogs read?”






 
 

Made in Pressure cooker. Super easy. Sautéed first and then added everything else. High for 12 minutes natural release. Perfect.








 
 
Tash, that’s just what I was about to ask!  Sealed pressure cooker wins in this heat.  Thanks tons for making it easy for me 😁.

Great recipe! I grew up not being a big fan of lentil soup but came across this recipe and the reviews convinced me to give it a try and I’m so glad I did! This recipe is also approved by a 1 yr old, 4 yr old and 8 yr old (picky kiddos)! Thank you for the recipe!!






 
 

As a uni student on a budget trying to eat healthier, this recipe is great, the lentil soup tastes amazing, and it indeed stays fine both in the fridge and the freezer






 
 
This soup was great!! Had to add a little water. I also added some cauliflower. Very hearty meal






 
 
Love your recipes more than anything or anyone else as soon as I see you name I will make it big fan thank you






 
 

Recipe is delicious. Does anyone know what the serving size is?






 
 

I made it tonight. I adjusted the recipe to 4 servings with the intent to freeze some. It made sooooo much. I have plenty to freeze. It is also very thick so I added more water to it. The lemon zest /juice is a great idea!!
