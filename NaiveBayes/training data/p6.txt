Taming the Monstera
Iâ€™ve been frequently asked about how I support my monstera so here are some details along with affiliate links to the products Iâ€™m using and enjoying. Â Purchasing through these links goes to support this blog ðŸ™‚
Do I need to train my Monstera deliciosa?
Yes! Â The growth pattern of the Monstera deliciosa is much like a pothos â€“ vines that just keep getting longer. Â For pothos, because of its smaller overall size, they can be left to hang off the side of the pot. Â Since the monsteraâ€™s natural size is much larger, a few vines hanging out of the pot would quickly fill an entire room! Â Therefore, you should affix the vines to a sturdy trellis so they can grow upwards.
What about using a moss pole?
The idea of the moss pole is to provide a medium onto which the aerial roots can grip, just like they do in the wild. Â The only problem with trying to accomplish this indoors is that you need to keep the moss moist at all times â€“ this is not recommended as the air doesnâ€™t move as much as it does outside or in a nursery. Â Stale air and constantly moist conditions are breeding grounds for mould/unwanted bacteria.
Even if you manage to keep the air fresh, a monsteraâ€™s vine can be quite heavy. Â A single post will not be as sturdy as a multi-post trellis.
Â 
The Metal Trellis
The method I use for training my monstera vines is affixing them against a sturdy metal trellis like the Panacea Garden Ladder. Â The triangular profile makes it much sturdier than a flat, fence-like design.
Soft Rubber Ties
Although the monstera vine is quite tough, I find that twine or wires will eventually dig into the plantâ€™s flesh. Â Thatâ€™s why I use these Soft Rubber Ties â€“ theyâ€™re strong, wonâ€™t slip once youâ€™ve twisted them against each other, and wonâ€™t mar the plant. Â They can be easily cut to whatever length you need.
When your monstera is young, fresh from the nursery, the vines probably wonâ€™t be hanging off the side of the pot for a few months. Â Given good light and watering accordingly, those vines will seem to crawl outwards â€“ this is the time to get them onto a trellis.
I hope this has been helpful for all you Monstera deliciosa parents out there.Â  If you havenâ€™t already, feel free to

Aerial roots: can I cut them?
If your growing conditions are good (adequate light) and youâ€™re watering/fertilizing accordingly, then everything keeps growing â€“ including aerial roots after theyâ€™re cut: A small Monstera deliciosa will eventually grow many aerial roots, creating a crazy jungle look â€“ hereâ€™s the view from below my monstera: I personally like this look but if youâ€™re looking [â€¦]






Misting: What is it actually useful for?
In my book, I stated that misting is about as useful to raise humidity as it is to light up a match to warm up a room: the effect on ambient humidity is minimal and temporary. And I donâ€™t use a humidifier anywhere â€“ my ambient indoor humidity in the winter goes down to 30% [â€¦]
