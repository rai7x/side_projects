To become a better plant parent, you must understand where your plants came from and what they think of your home…
What’s going on at the plant nursery?
these plants get an unobstructed view of the sky and, in the case of tropical foliage, direct sun is partially blocked by sheer fabric that lines the greenhouse roof.  And most importantly, the light is directly overhead so plants grow in the expected upright direction
with so much light, plants will be photosynthesizing rapidly, which therefore necessitates a consistently moist soil environment.  Because of rapid water usage by photosynthesis and good air circulation, there’s little chance of mold
again, with all the growth happening, other nutrients will need to be replenished
notice that in most commercial greenhouses, potted plants are in plastic pots with holes that we typically refer to as “drainage holes” but in the nursery, they also serve the purpose of allowing plants to be aerated from below in addition to on top of the soil
So plants growing at the nursery are hard at work producing carbohydrates from photosynthesis and using that stored up energy to grow structurally.
How does this compare to your home environment?
 if we’re only considering tropical foliage plants that do not need full sun, even for indirect light, the inside of your home is getting at best 25% the light they got at the nursery.  This drastic reduction in light completely changes how we must look after a plant in a home environment
 light is the major determinant of how quickly soil moisture is used up so you must check soil dryness before adding water.  Never blindly follow a schedule and never copy the routine used at the nursery
 there’s really no need for fertilization unless your plant is growing rapidly under greenhouse-like conditions.  It is most certainly NOT a supplement/replacement to good light/water
 for some reason, people have a tendency to repot their plants directly into decorative containers.  Whether or not they have a drainage hole, this potting method reduces root oxygenation and thus, overall root health
Stay tuned for the next blog post where I’ll give some ideas about what can be done in light of these growing conditions.  I hope this has changed your perspective about the plants growing (or starving) in your home.

Aerial roots: can I cut them?
If your growing conditions are good (adequate light) and you’re watering/fertilizing accordingly, then everything keeps growing – including aerial roots after they’re cut: A small Monstera deliciosa will eventually grow many aerial roots, creating a crazy jungle look – here’s the view from below my monstera: I personally like this look but if you’re looking […]






Misting: What is it actually useful for?
In my book, I stated that misting is about as useful to raise humidity as it is to light up a match to warm up a room: the effect on ambient humidity is minimal and temporary. And I don’t use a humidifier anywhere – my ambient indoor humidity in the winter goes down to 30% […]
