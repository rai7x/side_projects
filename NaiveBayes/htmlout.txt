The list originated as a one-off stunt by the staff of 
 magazine, who came up with the idea at the

  It was more successful than they expected and soon became established as a major event in the culinary world.


The World's 50 Best Restaurants list is compiled from the votes of the "World’s 50 Best Restaurants Academy", a group of 26 panels established to make the ranking.
 The world is divided into regions, with a chairperson in each region appointed for their knowledge of their part of the restaurant world. These chairs each selected a voting panel of 40 members, who every year cast thousands of votes.

There is no list of nominees; each member of the international voting panel votes for their own personal choice of ten restaurants. Up to six votes can be cast for restaurants in the voter's own region, while at least four must go to restaurants outside of the home region.
 No voting member is allowed to vote for their own restaurant, or one in which they have an economic interest, and voters must have eaten in the restaurants they nominate within the past 18 months. The integrity of the voting process and the resulting list is adjudicated by global consultancy firm Deloitte.
